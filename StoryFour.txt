The rain poured like a lover's tears on the city streets, each drop a reminder of all the dreams that slipped through his fingers, leaving only the scent of wet asphalt and longing. Concrete jungles, which is where dreams are made of. The sole light at the end of the street reminded him of how far his light has traveled in the time that has passed, leaving him hoping if it will ever return.
