The rain poured like a lover's tears on the city streets, each drop a reminder of all the dreams that slipped through his fingers, leaving only the scent of wet asphalt and longing.
A longing for a love not found on the very Earth he walks.
It had been a long few months since the event. It had reshaped the world he relied on for stability.
hello
Good poem bois
The End.
