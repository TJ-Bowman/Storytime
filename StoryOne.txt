He sat at the bar, smoke curling from his cigarette like regrets haning in the air, a broken jukebox humming the blues of a thousand empty nights.
A dozen or so empty glasses stood around him jeering at this man more empty than them. 
Then at once he stood up and said "Holy **** I am drunk!!"
A woman walked in to the bar and turned on the lights, she asked in cool smooth voice "What are you doing in my kitchen, and why did you drink all the milk?"
The man looks in horror, this woman said she drank milk! 'In her kitchen,' The man thought, 'Wait a minute... I'm lactose intolerant.'
